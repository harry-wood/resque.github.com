Hey y'all, [Chris Cerami](https://github.com/chrisccerami) here. It hasn't been quite as long in the making as 1.26.0, but after 11 months, Resque 1.27.0 has been released.

```ruby
#Gemfile

gem "resque", "~> 1.27.0"
```

Then just `bundle install`.

## Whatâ€™s new?

There have been a bunch of bug fixes in 1.27.0, as well as a few changes and additions. As always, the changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/resque/resque/blob/master/HISTORY.md#1270-2017-02-08). While it had originally been a goal to keep the changelog up to date during development, we didn't quite succeed there. Going forward, we would very much like to keep it up to date as pull requests are merged, to help keep history clear and accurate.

## Thanks to the Resque team!

I'd like to say a quick thank you to everyone who has contributed to Resque in the past year. Whether you were reviewing pull requests, submitting patches, opening issues, everyone has been super helpful in maintaining this bit of software we all rely on. It's been great to work with all of you!
